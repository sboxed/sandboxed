Implements the basic Material Design visual layout structure.

This class provides APIs for showing drawers and bottom sheets.

To display a persistent bottom sheet, obtain the
[ScaffoldState] for the current [BuildContext] via [Scaffold.of] and use the
[ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet] function.

{@tool dartpad}
This example shows a [Scaffold] with a [body] and [FloatingActionButton].
The [body] is a [Text] placed in a [Center] in order to center the text
within the [Scaffold]. The [FloatingActionButton] is connected to a
callback that increments a counter.

{@tool dartpad}
This example shows a [Scaffold] with a blueGrey [backgroundColor], [body]
and [FloatingActionButton]. The [body] is a [Text] placed in a [Center] in
order to center the text within the [Scaffold]. The [FloatingActionButton]
is connected to a callback that increments a counter.

{@tool dartpad}
This example shows a [Scaffold] with an [AppBar], a [BottomAppBar] and a
[FloatingActionButton]. The [body] is a [Text] placed in a [Center] in order
to center the text within the [Scaffold]. The [FloatingActionButton] is
centered and docked within the [BottomAppBar] using
[FloatingActionButtonLocation.centerDocked]. The [FloatingActionButton] is
connected to a callback that increments a counter.

## Scaffold layout, the keyboard, and display "notches"

The scaffold will expand to fill the available space. That usually
means that it will occupy its entire window or device screen. When
the device's keyboard appears the Scaffold's ancestor [MediaQuery]
widget's [MediaQueryData.viewInsets] changes and the Scaffold will
be rebuilt. By default the scaffold's [body] is resized to make
room for the keyboard. To prevent the resize set
[resizeToAvoidBottomInset] to false. In either case the focused
widget will be scrolled into view if it's within a scrollable
container.

The [MediaQueryData.padding] value defines areas that might
not be completely visible, like the display "notch" on the iPhone
X. The scaffold's [body] is not inset by this padding value
although an [appBar] or [bottomNavigationBar] will typically
cause the body to avoid the padding. The [SafeArea]
widget can be used within the scaffold's body to avoid areas
like display notches.

## Floating action button with a draggable scrollable bottom sheet

If [Scaffold.bottomSheet] is a [DraggableScrollableSheet],
[Scaffold.floatingActionButton] is set, and the bottom sheet is dragged to
cover greater than 70% of the Scaffold's height, two things happen in parallel:

  * Scaffold starts to show scrim (see [ScaffoldState.showBodyScrim]), and
  * [Scaffold.floatingActionButton] is scaled down through an animation with a [Curves.easeIn], and
    disappears when the bottom sheet covers the entire Scaffold.

And as soon as the bottom sheet is dragged down to cover less than 70% of the [Scaffold], the scrim
disappears and [Scaffold.floatingActionButton] animates back to its normal size.

## Troubleshooting

### Nested Scaffolds

The Scaffold is designed to be a top level container for
a [MaterialApp]. This means that adding a Scaffold
to each route on a Material app will provide the app with
Material's basic visual layout structure.

It is typically not necessary to nest Scaffolds. For example, in a
tabbed UI, where the [bottomNavigationBar] is a [TabBar]
and the body is a [TabBarView], you might be tempted to make each tab bar
view a scaffold with a differently titled AppBar. Rather, it would be
better to add a listener to the [TabController] that updates the
AppBar

{@tool snippet}
Add a listener to the app's tab controller so that the [AppBar] title of the
app's one and only scaffold is reset each time a new tab is selected.

```dart
TabController(vsync: tickerProvider, length: tabCount)..addListener(() {
  if (!tabController.indexIsChanging) {
    setState(() {
      // Rebuild the enclosing scaffold with a new AppBar title
      appBarTitle = 'Tab ${tabController.index}';
    });
  }
})
```
{@end-tool}

Although there are some use cases, like a presentation app that
shows embedded flutter content, where nested scaffolds are
appropriate, it's best to avoid nesting scaffolds.

 * [AppBar], which is a horizontal bar typically shown at the top of an app
   using the [appBar] property.
 * [BottomAppBar], which is a horizontal bar typically shown at the bottom
   of an app using the [bottomNavigationBar] property.
 * [FloatingActionButton], which is a circular button typically shown in the
   bottom right corner of the app using the [floatingActionButton] property.
 * [Drawer], which is a vertical panel that is typically displayed to the
   left of the body (and often hidden on phones) using the [drawer]
   property.
 * [BottomNavigationBar], which is a horizontal array of buttons typically
   shown along the bottom of the app using the [bottomNavigationBar]
   property.
 * [BottomSheet], which is an overlay typically shown near the bottom of the
   app. A bottom sheet can either be persistent, in which case it is shown
   using the [ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet] method, or modal, in which case
   it is shown using the [showModalBottomSheet] function.
 * [SnackBar], which is a lightweight message with an optional action which
   briefly displays at the bottom of the screen. Use the
   [ScaffoldMessengerState.showSnackBar] method to show snack bars.
 * [MaterialBanner], which displays an important, succinct message, at the
   top of the screen, below the app bar. Use the
   [ScaffoldMessengerState.showMaterialBanner] method to show material banners.
 * [ScaffoldState], which is the state associated with this widget.
