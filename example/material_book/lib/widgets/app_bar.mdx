A Material Design app bar.

An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a
[TabBar] and a [FlexibleSpaceBar]. App bars typically expose one or more
common [actions] with [IconButton]s which are optionally followed by a
[PopupMenuButton] for less common operations (sometimes called the "overflow
menu").

App bars are typically used in the [Scaffold.appBar] property, which places
the app bar as a fixed-height widget at the top of the screen. For a scrollable
app bar, see [SliverAppBar], which embeds an [AppBar] in a sliver for use in
a [CustomScrollView].

The AppBar displays the toolbar widgets, [leading], [title], and [actions],
above the [bottom] (if any). The [bottom] is usually used for a [TabBar]. If
a [flexibleSpace] widget is specified then it is stacked behind the toolbar
and the bottom widget. The following diagram shows where each of these slots
appears in the toolbar when the writing language is left-to-right (e.g.
English):

The [AppBar] insets its content based on the ambient [MediaQuery]'s padding,
to avoid system UI intrusions. It's taken care of by [Scaffold] when used in
the [Scaffold.appBar] property. When animating an [AppBar], unexpected
[MediaQuery] changes (as is common in [Hero] animations) may cause the content
to suddenly jump. Wrap the [AppBar] in a [MediaQuery] widget, and adjust its
padding such that the animation is smooth.

![The leading widget is in the top left, the actions are in the top right,
the title is between them. The bottom is, naturally, at the bottom, and the
flexibleSpace is behind all of them.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png)

If the [leading] widget is omitted, but the [AppBar] is in a [Scaffold] with
a [Drawer], then a button will be inserted to open the drawer. Otherwise, if
the nearest [Navigator] has any previous routes, a [BackButton] is inserted
instead. This behavior can be turned off by setting the [automaticallyImplyLeading]
to false. In that case a null leading widget will result in the middle/title widget
stretching to start.

{@tool dartpad}
This sample shows an [AppBar] with two simple actions. The first action
opens a [SnackBar], while the second action navigates to a new page.

Material Design 3 introduced new types of app bar.
{@tool dartpad}
This sample shows the creation of an [AppBar] widget with the [shadowColor] and
[scrolledUnderElevation] properties set, as described in:

{@end-tool}

## Troubleshooting

### Why don't my TextButton actions appear?

If the app bar's [actions] contains [TextButton]s, they will not
be visible if their foreground (text) color is the same as the
app bar's background color.

In Material v2 (i.e., when [ThemeData.useMaterial3] is false),
the default app bar [backgroundColor] is the overall theme's
[ColorScheme.primary] if the overall theme's brightness is
[Brightness.light]. Unfortunately this is the same as the default
[ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] for [TextButton] for light themes.
In this case a preferable text button foreground color is
[ColorScheme.onPrimary], a color that contrasts nicely with
[ColorScheme.primary]. To remedy the problem, override
[TextButton.style]:

{@tool dartpad}
This sample shows an [AppBar] with two action buttons with their primary
color set to [ColorScheme.onPrimary].

** See code in examples/api/lib/material/app_bar/app_bar.2.dart **
{@end-tool}

{@tool dartpad}
This example shows how to listen to a nested Scrollable's scroll notification
in a nested scroll view using the [notificationPredicate] property and use it
to make [scrolledUnderElevation] take effect.

** See code in examples/api/lib/material/app_bar/app_bar.3.dart **
{@end-tool}
