A Material Design chip.

Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or
action.

Supplying a non-null [onDeleted] callback will cause the chip to include a
button for deleting the chip.

Its ancestors must include [Material], [MediaQuery], [Directionality], and
[MaterialLocalizations]. Typically all of these widgets are provided by
[MaterialApp] and [Scaffold]. The [label] and [clipBehavior] arguments must
not be null.

{@tool snippet}

```dart
Chip(
  avatar: CircleAvatar(
    backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade800,
    child: const Text('AB'),
  ),
  label: const Text('Aaron Burr'),
)
```
{@end-tool}
