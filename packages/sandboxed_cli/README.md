# Sandboxed CLI

This is a placeholder package for future CLI tools that will be part of the Sandboxed ecosystem.

## About Sandboxed

Sandboxed is an application designed to help developers build, test, and showcase widget components in isolation. It provides a controlled environment where components can be developed and tested independently from the main application.

This CLI package will contain tools to enhance the Sandboxed workflow and improve the development experience when working with isolated components.

## Status

This package is currently a placeholder and under development. Future updates will include CLI tools to support the Sandboxed ecosystem.
